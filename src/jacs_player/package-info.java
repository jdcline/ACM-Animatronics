/**
 * A completely implemented animatronics show player. Will need to be
 * implemented alongside the {@link jmcc} package and the {@link jscc} package.
 * 
 * To utilize the player first create a MicrocontrollerConnection ({@link jmcc}
 * package), and then create the {@linkplain PlayerInputs}. Next create the
 * {@linkplain FormattedShowData}, and create an
 * {@linkplain AnimatronicsShowPlayer}. The player can then play, pause, resume,
 * and stop the show, starting and stopping at different times.
